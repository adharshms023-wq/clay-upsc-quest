## Architecture decisions
- Store user-facing account details in `public.profiles` with owner-scoped RLS, while authorization roles stay in `public.user_roles`; this keeps profile edits separate from privilege checks.
- Keep public study routes public and place profile/progress pages under the client-only authenticated layout; Supabase sessions are browser-persisted and unavailable during SSR.
